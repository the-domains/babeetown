In the past, parents used to think little girls only like pink and frilly frocks and little boys just wear blue pants. But that is considered to be standard "kiddy" attire (BORING) nowadays, and that ain't cool enough for mini fashionistas anymore.
Don't you just want to give your little girls and boys the best? Want to but don't know where to start looking for nice clothes and accessories?
Korea isn't just known for dressing up, but this country of kimchi is also famous for being able to recreate haute couture looks for cheap. It seems now there's now good news for local Singaporean parents wishing to dress their kids up like k-pop or Hollywood stars with Babeetown in town ^^.
Here's a how-to style guide for your little princesses. 

1\. Suri Cruise (Daughter of Tom Cruise)
For the Girly Girl
A popular and easy to match dressing style, look to Suri Cruise for tips on how to dress your little princess up in dresses and leggings with cute pumps.

For dresses, stick to babydoll, empire cuttings in solids or floral prints to carry off a style even a duchess would follow. White, navy, royal blue, red, and bright colors generally fall into safe range of colors to wear for stylish baby girl toddlers as compared to pink and purple.

2\. Alia Wang (Niece of Alexander Wang)
For the Funky Street Stylista
If mix and match street style is more your cup of tea, not to worry, here's Alia Wang to refer to for kiddy street style with a dash of class. Check out how she rocks socks with slippers. Her black princess ensemble is actually a two-piece put together using a frilly top in navy black and a skort/bloomer in black with a similar design. We love her red Mary Janes with leopard prints which gives this princess look a dash of spunk!
